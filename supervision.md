I have available space for supervisees. You are also welcome to contact me for one-off consultations or ad-hoc input if you feel I could be of use to you.

I hold a Diploma in Integrative Supervision of Individuals and Groups.

Supervision is offered on a sliding scale from Â£50-100 depending on your circumstances.

I am psychodynamically-trained, with a strong relational bent and a keen interest in other modalities. I feel I could be particularly helpful to:

- Integrative or humanistic therapists who are interested in psychodynamic ideas but uncertain about how to use these concepts practically in their work
- Those making the move into private practice who want support around this transition

I have particular interest/competency in supervising work with the following demographics/topics:

- LGBTQ clients
- Non-monogamous clients/non-normative sexual lives
- Disabled clients/those dealing with chronic health difficulties
- Developmental trauma (especially neglect in early life) 
- Working with countertransference
- Working with ADHD 
- Sexual difficulties (including where there is a physiological contribution)

You can get the ball rolling by contacting me: [effywesttherapy@gmail.com](mailto:effywesttherapy@gmail.com).
