I work with couples on an open-ended basis.

I offer an initial free-of-charge consultation to consider together whether therapy is the right thing for you as a couple at this moment in time, and if so whether I'm a good fit for you.

The fee for couple sessions is on a sliding scale from £90-£130. 

I work psychodynamically and relationally to help couples understand what is happening between them (and why!). Identifying recurring conflicts and understanding how they relate to your individual and shared histories can be enormously freeing and help you to break out of entrenched patterns.

I'm also undertaking additional training in psychosexual therapy at Tavistock Relationships and can offer sex therapy for couples or individuals. I use an integrative model for this, combining psychodynamic thinking with practical exercises for you to try between sessions.

Many different issues around sexuality and intimacy may be suitable for psychosexual and relational work. If you're not sure, don't hesitate to get in touch and arrange an initial consultation for us to think together about whether I could be of use to you as a couple.
