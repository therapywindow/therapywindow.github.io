A proportion of my week is reserved for my low cost clinic. These slots cost Â£25 a session whether for an individual or a couple and regardless of the type of work you want to do together. 

The low-cost clinic is intended to facilitate financial access for people who who don't have access to funds or wealth that would enable them to pay for a standard slot. 

I offer an initial free-of-charge consultation where we can think together about whether we're a good fit.

Demand for these spaces is very high and I operate a waiting list. Please get in touch to be added.

You can get the ball rolling by contacting me: [effywesttherapy@gmail.com](mailto:effywesttherapy@gmail.com).
