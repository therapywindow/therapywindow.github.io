A proportion of my week is reserved for my low cost clinic. These slots cost Â£25 a session whether for an individual or a couple and regardless of the type of work you want to do together. 

The low-cost clinic is intended to facilitate financial access for people who don't have the income or other wealth that would enable them to pay for a standard slot. There is no need to explain or justify your financial circumstances -- if you feel you would benefit from seeing me but it would cause you genuine hardship to pay my full fee, that is enough. Demand for these spaces is high and it may be some time before I can see you, but please do get in touch if you would like to arrange a consultation and join the waiting list.
