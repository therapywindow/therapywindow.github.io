“People do better with the truth than without it. People underestimate themselves and spend unnecessary energy protecting themselves from truths that they fear will kill them but which actually will make them stronger and make them happier. People want to do better. It’s not very difficult to find – underneath the heavy crust of resentment and fight— the wish to repair and the wish to love.”
