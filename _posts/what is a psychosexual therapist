And how is it different from talking to a regular therapist about sex?

If you need to talk about sex with a therapist, there are many options.

Many generalist therapists are comfortable talking about sex. Others may have a deeper interest in sexual matters and may even have some additional training (e.g. a short course or other form of continuing professional development).

A qualified psychosexual therapist will usually have a higher level of training and experience again. Often, they will have trained for a longer period (2 years or more) and undertaken a psychosexual placement under supervision from more experienced psychosexual practitioners. 

Because of this, they will be equipped not only to help with general anxieties related to sex, but also to diagnose and treat complex or engrained sexual problems, including where there is an ‘organic’ (non-psychological) contribution. Often they are trained to work with relationships, so they can treat sexual difficulties holistically in the relationship context where they occur. This is often more effective that trying to treat the difficulty in isolation.

A qualified psychosexual therapist is likely to be a good fit if you:

- want specialist help 
- would prefer to talk to someone who has almost certainly seen your sexual problem before!
- have had a sexual issue for a while, or if it keeps coming back
- aren’t sure if your sexual issue is physical or psychological (many are both!) 
- need guidance about or referrals to other professionals who could help with the issue
- would like to be seen with a partner (this is often more effective than being seen alone) 
- have brought your sexual difficulty to general therapy already and not had it improve
