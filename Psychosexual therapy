I am a qualified psychosexual therapist.

I have a particular specialism in dyspareunia (pain during sex) but I can assess and treat a range of sexual issues including but not limited to: low desire or desire discrepancy, erectile difficulties, orgasm-related struggles, or simply a general sense that sex could be more mutually satisfying and joyful!

I use an integrative psychosexual model, combining psychodynamic and attachment thinking with relevant education and practical exercises for you to try alone or with a partner between sessions.

Many different issues relating to sexuality and intimacy may be suitable for psychosexual and/or relationship work. If you're not sure, don't hesitate to get in touch and arrange an initial consultation. We will think together about whether I can be of use to you.
