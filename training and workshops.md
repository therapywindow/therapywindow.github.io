I offer training, workshops and ad-hoc consultations on a number of issues, including:

 * Gender and sexuality
 * Disability
 * Neurodiversity
 * Alternative relationships (non-monogamy etc)

### Workshops

When I deliver workshops my aim is to increase competency and confidence. Although I'm a fan of theory, I don't find that exhaustive lectures defining every possible piece of terminology do much except raise anxiety levels! Instead, I like to offer participants a chance to develop their way of thinking about the issue, equipping them with the skills and confidence to address these issues as they arise, to repair ruptures, and to continue developing their competency independently once the workshop is over.  

My workshops generally include creative exercises, some theoretical learning, and practical application of the knowledge acquired.
 
Workshops and trainings can be delivered in-person or online.
 

#### Feedback from previous workshop participants (shared with permission)

> "This was the first gender and sexuality workshop I have attended where I felt that it was properly inclusive. I appreciated the focus being on our own experiences. I also appreciated the inclusion of intersections of people's identities and a recognition of cultural differences. As a member of the LGBT+ community it felt like a safe space for me, even if others had views that I found difficult to hear - the discussion was contained and managed well."

> "The creative exercise at the beginning helped to draw holistically into the subject, make it learning not just at a cognitive level, but an embodied experience ... the role play, helped to put theory into practice."
