Welcome. My name is Effy. I’m an MNCS Accredited therapist and counsellor. I also teach, train and supervise counsellors and therapists.

I offer a mixture of exploration, insight and gentle challenge to help those I work with understand their lives and interpersonal worlds in greater depth.

An initial free-of-charge consultation is available to anyone interested in exploring whether they'd like to work with me. 

You can get the ball rolling by contacting me: [effywesttherapy@gmail.com](mailto:effywesttherapy@gmail.com).

<b>What can I help with?</b>

Many of my clients seek out therapy with me because they:

⁃ Struggle to consistently feel ‘good enough’ and would like to build more resilient self-esteem

⁃ Find it hard to set healthy boundaries in different areas of their lives and want to find ways to do so

⁃ Can’t seem to find balance— particularly around work and play

⁃ Would like to understand how their life experiences are affecting their relationships in the present, opening up new possibilities for relating

⁃ Have experienced marginalisation and want a therapist who strives to take an inclusive stance (I am committed to continually learning and improving through personal and professional reflection and by listening to the experiences of those with identities different from my own)

The above list is not exhaustive -- I also work with trauma, interpersonal problems, life transitions, and ongoing mental health difficulties (including, but certainly not limited to, depression and anxiety).

You might not be sure whether I work with the issues you want to bring. Please feel free to contact me — we can consider together whether I’m the right therapist for you. If I'm not, I can usually think of a trusted colleague or two who might be a better fit and I can put you in touch with them.

<b>How do you work?</b>

I am psychodynamically trained, though I occasionally draw on other approaches. I am very happy to discuss how we will work together at the beginning, and throughout the process.
