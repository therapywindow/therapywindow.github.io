Iâ€™m a qualified psychodynamic therapist and counsellor.

I work with a range of difficulties, including stress, mental health problems, traumatic experiences and interpersonal difficulties.

I offer open-ended or shorter-term therapy. Sessions are usually once a week, for 50 minutes.

Some low-cost spaces are available for those who have no/a very limited income. Please get in touch.

You can reach me at [effywesttherapy@gmail.com](mailto:effywesttherapy@gmail.com).
