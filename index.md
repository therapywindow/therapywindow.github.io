I’m a qualified psychodynamic therapist and counsellor.

I work with a range of difficulties, including stress, mental health problems, traumatic experiences and interpersonal difficulties. I have a particular interest in difficult childhood experiences and how they affect our relationships in the present.

I offer open-ended or shorter-term therapy. Sessions are usually once a week, for 50 minutes.

Sessions cost £70. Some low-cost spaces are available for those who are on a low income and do not have access to funds or other wealth. I operate a waiting list for these spaces. Please get in touch to discuss what may be possible.

You can reach me at [effywesttherapy@gmail.com](mailto:effywesttherapy@gmail.com).
