description: Counselling and psychotherapy in London
---

I’m a psychodynamic therapist and counsellor who has experience in working with the LGBTQ community, mental health problems, and complex trauma. I am particularly interested in how we relate to one another and the histories we bring to relationships.

My practice is informed by critical and reflective feminist (trans and sex worker-inclusive) perspectives.

My session fee is £70. A number of low-cost spaces are available for those who have no/a very limited income. Please get in touch.

You can reach me at [effywesttherapy@gmail.com](mailto:effywesttherapy@gmail.com)
