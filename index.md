Welcome. My name is Effy. I’m an MNCS Accredited therapist and counsellor offering 1-to-1 therapeutic work, at present only online. 

I also offer couple and psychosexual work in my capacity as a trainee psychosexual therapist.

I offer a mixture of exploration, insight and gentle challenge to help my clients understand their lives and interpersonal worlds in greater depth. My training was psychodynamic in orientation. 

<b>What can I help with?</b>

Many of my clients seek out therapy with me because they:

⁃ Struggle to consistently feel ‘good enough’ and would like to build more resilient self-esteem

⁃ Find it hard to set healthy boundaries in different areas of their lives and want to find ways to do so

⁃ Can’t seem to find balance— particularly around work and play

⁃ Would like to understand how their life experiences are affecting their relationships in the present, opening up new possibilities for relating

⁃ Have experienced marginalisation and want a therapist who strives to take an inclusive stance (I am committed to continually learning and improving by listening to the lived experiences of those with identities different from my own)

The above list is not exhaustive, and I also work with trauma, interpersonal problems, life transitions, and ongoing mental health difficulties (including, but certainly not limited to, depression and anxiety).

You might not be sure whether I work with the issues you want to bring. Please feel free to contact me — we can consider together whether I’m the right therapist for you. If not, I can usually think of a trusted colleague or two who might be a better fit and put you in touch with them.

<b>How does it work?</b>

I am psychodynamically-trained, though I occasionally draw on other approaches. I am very happy to discuss how we will work together at the beginning, and throughout the process.

**For individuals**
Usually I work on an open-ended basis. Sessions take place once a week for 50 minutes. Sessions cost £70. A small number of low-cost spaces are available for those who are on a low income and do not have access to funds or other wealth.  Please get in touch to discuss what may be possible.

**For couples**
I'm a trainee psychosexual therapist. I can offer sessions for couples at a reduced rate of £50 a session (psychosexual therapy typically costs £80-100 for couples). I am training in an integrative model that combines psychodynamic relational thinking with practical behavioural interventions. I am also very interested in how the psychosocial affects our relationship to sex and pleasure, and how marginalisation plays into things. 

Many different issues around sexuality and intimacy may be suitable for psychosexual work, but if you're not sure, don't hesitate to get in touch.
