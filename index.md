I’m a qualified psychodynamic therapist and counsellor. Part-time, I lecture in counselling, and the rest of the time I run my private practice and engage in continuing professional development, including convening reading groups and peer supervision.

I work with a range of difficulties, including stress, mental health problems, traumatic experiences and interpersonal difficulties.

My session fee is £100. A number of low-cost spaces are available for those who have no/a very limited income. Please get in touch.

You can reach me at [effywesttherapy@gmail.com](mailto:effywesttherapy@gmail.com).
