I work with couples on an open-ended basis.

I offer an initial free-of-charge consultation where we can think together about whether therapy is the right thing for you as a couple right now, and if so whether I'm a good fit for you.

The fee for couple sessions is on a sliding scale from £90-£130. 

I'm also undertaking advanced training in psychosexual therapy at Tavistock Relationships and can offer sex therapy for couples or individuals. 

Many different issues around sexuality and intimacy may be suitable for psychosexual and relational work. If you're not sure, don't hesitate to get in touch and arrange an initial consultation for us to think together about whether it could be of use to you as a couple.

You can get the ball rolling by contacting me: [effywesttherapy@gmail.com](mailto:effywesttherapy@gmail.com).
