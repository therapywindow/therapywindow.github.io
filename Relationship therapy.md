I work with couples and other relationship configurations (including non-monogamous and polyamorous arrangements, and open relationships more generally).

I work in an attachment-focused way to help people understand what is happening between them (and why!). I support couples to identify recurring conflicts, break negative cycles, and build new and enduring patterns of positive and secure relating.

I am also a qualified psychosexual therapist. I can assess and help with a range of sexual issues including but not limited to: low desire or desire discrepancy, erectile difficulties, pain during sex, orgasm-related struggles, or simply a general sense that sex could be more mutually satisfying and joyful!

I use an integrative psychosexual model, combining psychodynamic and attachment thinking with education and practical exercises for you to try between sessions.

Many different issues around sexuality and intimacy may be suitable for psychosexual and/or relationship work. If you're not sure, don't hesitate to get in touch and arrange an initial consultation. We will think together about whether I can be of use to you. 

The fee for these sessions is on a sliding scale from £130-£180 per session. I ask clients to place themselves on this scale according to what they can afford. This fee structure allows me to subsidise [low-cost places](https://www.effywest.com/low-cost-clinic/) in my clinic. 

I offer an initial free-of-charge consultation to consider together whether therapy is the right thing for your relationship at this moment in time, and if so whether I'm a good fit for you.
