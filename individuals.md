I offer psychodynamic counselling and therapy. Typically I work on an open-ended basis. Sessions take place once a week for 50 minutes and are on a sliding scale from £80-£110.

I offer an initial free-of-charge consultation where we can think together about whether we're a good fit.

*I reserve a limited number of low-cost spaces in my practice for those who would otherwise be unable to see me. See my [low-cost clinic page](https://www.effywest.com/low-cost-clinic/) for details of how to be added to the waiting list.*
